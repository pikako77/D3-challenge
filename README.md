# Data Journalism and D3
##### Homework 16

## Objective
- Visualize [2014 ACS 1-year estimates](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml). <br>The dataset includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state.
Data are visuzalized using D3. 

## Methodology
- Visualization is built in two level of difficulties: 
 <br>Level 1 for basic visualization, and 
 <br>Level 2 for multi-axis visualization. 

 ## Level 1
 In level 1, we insure that data integrity by manipulating and plotting a pair of data. In our example, we choose to look if there is a relationship between "poverty" and "healthcare".

 ## Level 2
 In level 2, we will transform the static and basic Level1 graph into an interactive graph. We will integrate additional data from [2014 ACS 1-year estimates](https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml), such as "Obesity", "Smoking rate", "Household income", and "Age". 
 The graph will be automatically by clicking on the axis label.
<br>
Default setting is set to "poverty" and "healthcare"

Example of graph for "Obesity" and "Household income" is shown below:
